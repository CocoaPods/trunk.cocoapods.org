[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/CocoaPods/trunk.cocoapods.org/Specs)](https://github.com/CocoaPods/trunkg.cocoapods.org/actions)


Available under the MIT license.

## Installation

1. Create a testing sandbox repository on GitHub and, from the CocoaPods specification repository,
   add the [`Gemfile`](https://raw.github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/master/Gemfile) and
   [`Rakefile`](https://raw.github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/master/Rakefile) files.

2. Install PostgreSQL. (On OS X you can use the [Postgres App](http://postgresapp.com).)

3. Install the dependencies:

        $ rake bootstrap

4. Run the before script to set up your db

        $ ./.github/scripts/before.sh

5. Test whether or not a pod sends correctly

        $ ./bin/test-push localhost:4567 spec/fixtures/AFNetworking.podspec

## Usage

To start a development server run the following command, replacing the
environment variables with your GitHub credentials, a GitHub testing sandbox
repository, and a SHA hashed version of the password for the admin area (in
this example the password is ‘secret’):

    env RACK_ENV=development \
        GH_USERNAME=alloy GH_EMAIL=user@example.com GH_TOKEN=secret GH_REPO=alloy/trunk.cocoapods.org-test \
        TRUNK_APP_PUSH_ALLOWED=true TRUNK_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=2bb80d537b1da3e38bd30361aa855686bde0eacd7162fef6a25fe97bf527a25b \
        rake serve

Optional environment variables are:

* `RACK_ENV`: Can be test, development, or production.
* `DATABASE_URL`: The URL to the PostgreSQL database.

## Webhook

The webhook sends messages to other services when events in trunk happen.

These events trigger the webhook and send a message.

* Successful create of a pod: `{'type':'pod','action':'create','timestamp':'<date>','data_url':'<URL>'}`
* Successful create of a version: `{'type':'version','action':'create','timestamp':'<date>','data_url':'<URL>'}`
* Successful update of a spec: `{'type':'spec','action':'update','timestamp':'<date>','data_url':'<URL>'}`

Environment variables are:

* `OUTGOING_HOOK_PATH`: The garbled path used at the end of `<schema>://<domain>/hooks/trunk/<OUTGOING_HOOK_PATH>`.
* `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED`: If set to `true`, the webhook is enabled.

### Usage in Trunk

Enable:

    Webhook.enable

Disable:

    Webhook.disable

Trigger a message explicitly:

    Webhook.pod_created(created_at, data_url)
    Webhook.version_created(created_at, data_url)
    Webhook.spec_updated(updated_at, data_url)

Change the webhook service URLs with the hook config methods:

    Webhook.pod_created = [urls]
    Webhook.version_created = [urls]
    Webhook.spec_updated = [urls]

Check if it is enabled:

    Webhook.enabled?

### Usage in interested web services

Note: The webhooks are currently only available to CP internal services. We are looking into opening them up for public use after some intensive testing.

1. Add your URL wherever one of the hook config methods (see above) is called (currently in `ìnit.rb`).
2. We recommend you add `OUTGOING_HOOK_PATH` to the path to at least obscure your path.
3. Install a POST route in your service that corresponds to the URL. Note: You MUST NOT use the value in `OUTGOING_HOOK_PATH` inside your public code. Instead, use an ENV variable as well, and set it to correspond to `OUTGOING_HOOK_PATH`.

You'll then receive POSTs to the URL with content `message=<JSON data>`.
