  p You have successfully claimed the following #{ pod_message } and are now registered as #{params[:successfully_claimed].size == 1 ? 'its' : 'their'} ‘owner’: #{params[:successfully_claimed].to_sentence}.

  p If you have any co-maintainers, you can now add them as ‘owners’ as well. For information on how to do this see the <a href = "http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/getting-setup-with-trunk">getting started with Trunk</a> guide.

  p Once we have finished the transition period, you will be able to push new versions of #{params[:successfully_claimed].size == 1 ? 'these pods' : 'this pod'} directly from the command-line.
